## Step 1: Create New Development Branch
- Repo: staffingboss-reactapp
- Playbook: <none>
- Prompt: Create a new branch called `devin/<unique-timestamp>/apply-ag-grid` that checks out from the existing branch `devin/050825/setup-storybook`. Use a unique timestamp in the format MMDDYY-HHMM or similar to ensure branch uniqueness. Verify the branch creation and confirm you're working on the new branch with the Storybook setup as the foundation.
- Handoff: Provide the exact branch name created, confirmation of successful checkout from `devin/050825/setup-storybook`, and current git status showing the new branch is active.

## Step 2: Analyze ag-Grid Documentation and Install
- Repo: staffingboss-reactapp
- Playbook: <none>
- Prompt: Visit https://www.ag-grid.com/example/ and analyze the documentation to understand how to install and set up ag-Grid in a React/JavaScript project. Focus on the getting started guide, basic installation steps, and simple grid examples. Create a detailed installation plan including required dependencies, basic configuration, and a simple data grid example. Document the recommended approach for integrating ag-Grid into a modern frontend project. After analysis, install ag-Grid into the project using the created branch from Step 1. Create a basic React component called `DataGridDemo` that implements a simple ag-Grid with sample data (at least 10 rows with columns like name, age, country, company). Test basic functionality like sorting and filtering.
- Handoff: Provide the installation command(s) used, exact component file path, component code structure, sample data used, and confirmation that ag-Grid is working with basic functionality in the new branch.

## Step 3: Integrate ag-Grid Component into Storybook
- Repo: staffingboss-reactapp
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Playbook: <none>
- Prompt: Using the working ag-Grid component from Step 2 and the existing Storybook configuration from the base branch, inject the `DataGridDemo` component into Storybook. Create a comprehensive story that showcases the ag-Grid component with multiple variants (basic grid, different data sets, various configurations). Start the Storybook preview server and verify the ag-Grid renders properly with interactive functionality. Ensure users can interact with sorting, filtering, and other grid features within the Storybook environment.
- Handoff: Provide the story file path, story configurations created, confirmation that Storybook preview is running successfully, the complete Storybook URL for accessing the ag-Grid story, and verification that all interactive features work in the live preview.
