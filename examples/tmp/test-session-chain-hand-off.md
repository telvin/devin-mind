## Overview
This workflow demonstrates independent development tasks for learning various programming concepts and tools. Each step is self-contained and can be executed independently without relying on previous steps or requiring handoffs.

## Workflow Steps

## Step 1: Create Python Data Analysis Script
- Playbook: <none>
- Prompt: Create a Python script that analyzes a CSV dataset. Generate sample data with at least 100 rows containing columns for name, age, salary, and department. Implement functions to calculate average salary by department, find the oldest employee, and create a simple visualization using matplotlib. Save the results to a summary file.

## Step 2: Build HTML/CSS Landing Page
- Playbook: <none>
- Prompt: Design and build a responsive landing page for a fictional coffee shop using pure HTML and CSS. Include a hero section, menu showcase, contact information, and footer. Use modern CSS techniques like flexbox or grid for layout. Ensure the page is mobile-friendly and includes hover effects on interactive elements.

## Step 3: Implement JavaScript Calculator
- Playbook: <none>
- Prompt: Create a fully functional calculator application using vanilla JavaScript. Build a clean user interface with buttons for digits (0-9), basic operations (+, -, *, /), equals, and clear functions. Handle edge cases like division by zero and consecutive operations. Style the calculator with CSS to make it visually appealing.

## Step 4: Write Bash File Organizer Script
- Playbook: <none>
- Prompt: Create a Bash script that organizes files in a directory by their extensions. The script should move files into subdirectories based on file type (images/, documents/, videos/, etc.). Include error handling, logging functionality, and the ability to undo the organization. Make the script executable and add help documentation.

## Step 5: Design Database Schema
- Playbook: <none>
- Prompt: Design a complete database schema for a library management system using SQL. Create tables for books, authors, members, and borrowing records. Include appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. Write sample INSERT statements to populate the database and create useful queries for common operations like finding overdue books.

## Dependency Chain Analysis

**Independent Flow:**
- All steps are completely independent
- No step relies on outputs from other steps
- Each step can be executed in any order
- No handoff data required between steps

## Expected Outcomes

- ✅ Python data analysis script with visualizations
- ✅ Responsive HTML/CSS landing page
- ✅ Functional JavaScript calculator application
- ✅ Bash file organization script with error handling
- ✅ Complete SQL database schema with sample data

## Development Patterns Demonstrated

- **Data Analysis**: Python scripting and visualization
- **Web Development**: Responsive design and modern CSS
- **Interactive Applications**: JavaScript DOM manipulation
- **System Administration**: Bash scripting and file management
- **Database Design**: SQL schema creation and query optimization
