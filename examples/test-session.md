## Overview
This workflow demonstrates basic Git operations including branch creation, file management, and content enhancement. Perfect for learning version control fundamentals and collaborative development practices.

## Workflow Steps

## Step 1: Create Feature Branch
- Playbook: 6d971ce2ba174c108cd91f4fc40e5392
- Prompt: Create a new Git branch with name format `devin/<uniqueNumber>/experiment-devin-session-api` while uniqueNumber is a random 6-digit number. Initialize the branch and ensure it's ready for development.
- Handoff: Provide the exact branch name that was created (format: devin/######/experiment-devin-session-api)

## Step 2: Create and Commit Test Document
- Playbook: <none>
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Prompt: Using the branch name which is created, switch to that branch and create a file named "test-doc.md". Add basic placeholder content including a title, introduction section, and some sample text. Commit the file and push it to the remote repository.
- Handoff: Confirm the test-doc.md file was created, committed, and pushed successfully with the commit hash

## Step 3: Content Enhancement and Review
- Playbook: <none>
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Prompt: Review the current content of test-doc.md file from the previous step. Enhance the document by adding a comprehensive paragraph of approximately 500 characters that provides meaningful content about the purpose and usage of the document. Ensure proper markdown formatting and commit the changes.
- Handoff: Deliver the enhanced test-doc.md with improved content and confirmation of successful commit

## Dependency Chain Analysis

**Sequential Flow:**
- Step 1: Branch Creation (foundation)
- Step 1 → Step 2 (file creation requires branch)
- Step 2 → Step 3 (content enhancement requires existing file)
