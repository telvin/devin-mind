## Overview
This workflow demonstrates a sequential frontend development process where each step builds upon the previous step's handoff data. The workflow focuses on analyzing, installing, and integrating ag-Grid with Storybook to create an interactive data grid component showcase.

## Workflow Steps

## Step 1: Analyze ag-Grid Documentation and Create Installation Plan
- Repo: staffingboss-reactapp
- Playbook: <none>
- Prompt: Visit https://www.ag-grid.com/ and analyze the documentation to understand how to install and set up ag-Grid in a React/JavaScript project. Focus on the getting started guide, basic installation steps, and simple grid examples. Create a detailed installation plan including required dependencies, basic configuration, and a simple data grid example. Document the recommended approach for integrating ag-Grid into a modern frontend project.
- Handoff: Provide the installation command(s), required dependencies list, basic configuration code snippet, and a simple data structure example that will be used for the grid setup in the next step.

## Step 2: Install and Setup ag-Grid in Project
- Repo: staffingboss-reactapp
- Playbook: <none>
- Prompt: Using the installation plan and dependencies from Step 1, install ag-Grid in the project. Create a basic React component called `DataGridDemo` that implements a simple ag-Grid with the data structure provided in the handoff. Include basic column definitions, row data, and default grid options. Ensure the grid renders properly and displays sample data (at least 10 rows with columns like name, age, country, company). Test the basic functionality like sorting and filtering.
- Handoff: Provide the exact component file path, component code structure, sample data used, and confirmation that the ag-Grid is working with basic functionality. Include any specific props or configuration needed for the next step.

## Step 3: Setup Storybook for Component Documentation
- Repo: staffingboss-reactapp
- Playbook: <none>
- Prompt: Install and configure Storybook in the project. Set up the basic Storybook configuration and create the project structure for stories. Ensure Storybook can run properly and serves the default welcome page. Configure any necessary webpack settings or dependencies to work with the existing project setup. Create a basic story structure that will be ready to showcase the ag-Grid component.
- Handoff: Provide the Storybook installation commands used, configuration files created, the command to run Storybook, and confirmation that Storybook is running successfully on the local development server. Include the port number and any specific setup requirements.

## Step 4: Create ag-Grid Story and Live Preview
- Repo: staffingboss-reactapp
- Playbook: <none>
- Prompt: Using the working ag-Grid component from Step 2 and the configured Storybook from Step 3, create a comprehensive Storybook story for the `DataGridDemo` component. Include multiple story variants showing different grid configurations (basic grid, grid with custom styling, grid with different data sets). Ensure the story renders the ag-Grid properly in Storybook's live preview. Add controls/knobs for interactive testing of grid properties like theme, pagination, and sorting options. Verify that the live preview works and users can interact with the grid within Storybook.
- Handoff: Provide the story file path, story configurations created, screenshots or description of the working live preview, and instructions for accessing and testing the ag-Grid component in Storybook. Include the complete Storybook URL for the ag-Grid story.

## Dependency Chain Analysis

**Sequential Flow:**
- Step 1 → Step 2: Installation plan and dependencies required for proper setup
- Step 2 → Step 3: Working ag-Grid component needed for Storybook integration
- Step 3 → Step 4: Configured Storybook environment required for story creation
- Step 4: Final integration showcasing the complete ag-Grid + Storybook solution

## Expected Outcomes

- ✅ Comprehensive ag-Grid installation and setup documentation
- ✅ Working ag-Grid React component with sample data and basic functionality
- ✅ Properly configured Storybook development environment
- ✅ Interactive Storybook story showcasing ag-Grid component with live preview
- ✅ Complete frontend development workflow demonstrating modern tooling integration

## Development Patterns Demonstrated

- **Documentation Analysis**: Research and planning for third-party library integration
- **Package Management**: Installing and configuring npm/yarn dependencies
- **Component Development**: Creating reusable React components with external libraries
- **Development Tooling**: Setting up and configuring Storybook for component documentation
- **Integration Testing**: Combining multiple tools and ensuring they work together seamlessly
