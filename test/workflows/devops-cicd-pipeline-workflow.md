# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

**Complexity Level**: Intermediate (6 Steps)  
**Duration Estimate**: 1-1.5 hours  
**Dependencies**: Mixed (4 dependent, 2 independent steps)

## Overview
This workflow demonstrates building a complete DevOps pipeline with infrastructure as code, automated testing, containerization, deployment automation, and comprehensive monitoring with disaster recovery.

## Workflow Steps

## Step 1: Infrastructure Setup
- Playbook: infrastructure-setup
- Prompt: Set up cloud infrastructure with Terraform for development, staging, and production environments
- Handoff: Provide infrastructure as code with environment configurations

## Step 2: CI Pipeline
- Playbook: ci-pipeline
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Prompt: Create CI pipeline with automated testing, code quality checks, and security scanning
- Handoff: Deliver GitHub Actions workflow with quality gates

## Step 3: Containerization (Independent)
- Playbook: containerization
- RelyPreviousStep: no
- Prompt: Containerize applications with Docker and create optimized images
- Handoff: Provide Docker images with multi-stage builds and security scanning

## Step 4: CD Pipeline
- Playbook: cd-pipeline
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Prompt: Implement CD pipeline with automated deployment to staging and production
- Handoff: Deliver automated deployment pipeline with rollback capabilities

## Step 5: Monitoring & Alerting
- Playbook: monitoring-alerting
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Prompt: Set up comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and incident response
- Handoff: Provide monitoring stack with SLA dashboards and alerting rules

## Step 6: Backup & Disaster Recovery
- Playbook: backup-disaster-recovery
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Prompt: Implement backup strategies and disaster recovery procedures
- Handoff: Deliver backup automation and disaster recovery playbook

## Dependency Chain Analysis

**Independent Steps:**
- Step 1: Infrastructure Setup (foundation)
- Step 3: Containerization (parallel development)

**Dependent Steps:**
- Step 2 → Step 1 (CI needs infrastructure)
- Step 4 → Step 2 (CD builds on CI)
- Step 5 → Step 4 (monitoring deployed services)
- Step 6 → Step 5 (DR includes monitoring)

## Expected Outcomes

- ✅ Multi-environment cloud infrastructure
- ✅ Automated CI/CD pipelines
- ✅ Containerized applications
- ✅ Blue-green deployments
- ✅ Real-time monitoring and alerting
- ✅ Automated backup and disaster recovery

## Tools & Technologies

- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, AWS/Azure/GCP
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Security**: SAST, DAST, container scanning
