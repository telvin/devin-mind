# E-Commerce Platform Development Workflow

**Complexity Level**: Advanced (10 Steps)  
**Duration Estimate**: 2-3 hours  
**Dependencies**: Mixed (7 dependent, 3 independent steps)

## Overview
This workflow demonstrates building a complete e-commerce platform from requirements analysis through production deployment. It showcases complex step dependencies, multiple playbooks, and comprehensive handoff management.

## Workflow Steps

## Step 1: Requirements Analysis
- Playbook: requirements-analysis
- Prompt: Analyze requirements for a modern e-commerce platform with user management, product catalog, shopping cart, and payment processing
- Handoff: Provide detailed requirements document with technical specifications

## Step 2: Architecture Design
- Playbook: architecture-design
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Prompt: Design the system architecture including microservices, database design, and API structure
- Handoff: Deliver complete architecture documentation with diagrams

## Step 3: Database Development
- Playbook: database-development
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Prompt: Implement the database schema with user tables, product catalog, orders, and payment records
- Handoff: Provide database migration scripts and seed data

## Step 4: Authentication Service
- Playbook: auth-service
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Prompt: Build authentication and authorization service with JWT tokens and role-based access
- Handoff: Deliver working authentication API with middleware

## Step 5: Product Service (Independent)
- Playbook: product-service
- RelyPreviousStep: no
- Prompt: Create product catalog service with search, filtering, and inventory management
- Handoff: Provide product management API with admin interface

## Step 6: Shopping Cart Service
- Playbook: cart-service
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Prompt: Implement shopping cart service with session management and cart persistence
- Handoff: Deliver cart API with real-time updates

## Step 7: Payment Service (Independent)
- Playbook: payment-service
- RelyPreviousStep: no
- Prompt: Integrate payment processing with Stripe, including webhooks and transaction handling
- Handoff: Provide secure payment API with fraud detection

## Step 8: Frontend Application
- Playbook: frontend-app
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Prompt: Build React frontend with product browsing, cart management, and checkout flow
- Handoff: Deliver complete e-commerce web application

## Step 9: Testing & QA
- Playbook: testing-qa
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Prompt: Create comprehensive test suite including unit, integration, and e2e tests
- Handoff: Provide test automation with CI/CD pipeline

## Step 10: Deployment & Monitoring
- Playbook: deployment-monitoring
- RelyPreviousStep: yes
- Prompt: Deploy to production with monitoring, logging, and performance tracking
- Handoff: Deliver production-ready platform with monitoring dashboard

## Dependency Chain Analysis

**Independent Steps:**
- Step 1: Requirements Analysis (starting point)
- Step 5: Product Service (can be developed in parallel)
- Step 7: Payment Service (can be developed in parallel)

**Dependent Steps:**
- Step 2 → Step 1 (architecture based on requirements)
- Step 3 → Step 2 (database based on architecture)
- Step 4 → Step 3 (auth service uses database)
- Step 6 → Step 5 (cart service integrates with products)
- Step 8 → Step 6 (frontend uses cart functionality)
- Step 9 → Step 8 (testing the complete application)
- Step 10 → Step 9 (deployment after testing)

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this workflow, you will have:
- ✅ Complete e-commerce platform architecture
- ✅ Secure user authentication and authorization
- ✅ Product catalog with search and inventory
- ✅ Shopping cart with persistence
- ✅ Integrated payment processing
- ✅ Modern React frontend
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Production deployment with monitoring

## Performance Metrics

**Typical Execution Times:**
- Total workflow: 2-3 hours
- Average step time: 12-18 minutes
- Longest steps: Architecture Design, Frontend Development
- Shortest steps: Database Development, Cart Service

## Usage with MCP Server

To execute this workflow with the Devin MCP server:
